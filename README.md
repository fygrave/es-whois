es-whois
========

Generic WHOIS server to search  Elastic Search Database. This is basically

 a whois server to serve as frontend for ElasticSearch query. Schema-agnostic.

The core of the code was taken from  https://github.com/Rafiot/Whois-Server/
and then hacked in accordance with our orthodox obsession with Elastic Search :)
